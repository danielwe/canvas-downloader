> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of <https://github.com/aik2mlj/canvas-downloader>, fixing a couple of issues I encountered:
>
> - File and folder naming conflicts, for example when multiple announcements have the same title, are avoided
> - A bug where query parameters were combinatorially duplicated, ultimately leading to a panic, is fixed
> - An issue increasing the likelihood of connection timeouts for courses with a lot of material is addressed
> - Fallbacks and errors/warnings upon receiving HTTP 404 are improved

# Canvas Downloader

A command-line tool to download and organize all your Canvas course materials—files, syllabi, pages, modules, assignments, discussions, and announcements—into a clean local folder structure. Made in async Rust⚡.

## Installation

#### 🍺 Homebrew (macOS/Linux) <a href="https://repology.org/project/canvas-downloader/versions"> <img src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/canvas-downloader.svg" alt="Packaging status" align="right"> </a>

```bash
brew install aik2mlj/tap/canvas-downloader
```

#### 📦 AUR (Arch Linux)

```bash
# use pre-built binary
paru -S canvas-downloader-bin
# or if you prefer, compile from source
paru -S canvas-downloader
```

#### 🍦 Scoop (Windows)

```powershell
scoop bucket add aik2mlj https://github.com/aik2mlj/scoop-bucket; scoop install aik2mlj/canvas-downloader
```

#### 🛠️ Cargo (All platforms)

```bash
# use pre-built binary
# you need to have cargo-binstall installed first
cargo binstall canvas-downloader
# or compile from source
cargo install canvas-downloader
```

#### ⬇️ Download from Releases (All platforms)

- Download the corresponding binary archive from [Releases](https://github.com/aik2mlj/canvas-downloader/releases)
- Decompress the archive file
- Directly run the executable from terminal, or move it to `$PATH` for easier access

For macOS, the following commands may be needed because the binary isn't signed with an Apple developer account. Also see [Apple's official doc](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac?utm_source=chatgpt.com) on this.

```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine canvas-downloader
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Configuration File

You can copy the [example config](examples/config.toml) into one of the **config file locations (searched in order):**

1. Custom path via `--config` option
1. `canvas-downloader.toml` in current directory
1. `config.toml` in platform-specific config directory:
   - Linux: `~/.config/canvas-downloader/config.toml`
   - macOS: `~/.config/canvas-downloader/config.toml` or `~/Library/Application Support/canvas-downloader/config.toml`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\canvas-downloader\config.toml`

Then modify it to your Canvas instance URL and access token.

#### How to get your token

- Log in to Canvas → Account → Settings → **New Access Token**

### 2. Discover Your Courses

Run the tool to see which courses are available:

```shell
$ canvas-downloader
Please provide either Term ID(s) via -t or course name(s)/code(s) via -c
Term ID    | Course Code | Course Name
-----------------------------------------------------------
115        | CS1101S     | Programming Methodology
           | CS1231S     | Discrete Structures
-----------------------------------------------------------
120        | CS2040S     | Data Structures and Algorithms
           | CS2030      | Programming Methodology II
-----------------------------------------------------------
125        | CS3230      | Design and Analysis of Algorithms
```

### 3. Download Your Courses

You can download courses by term ID or by course name/code:

**Download by terms (all courses in specific terms):**

```shell
$ canvas-downloader -t 115 120
```

**Download by course names and/or codes (specific courses only):**

```shell
$ canvas-downloader -c CS1101S "Introduction to Data Structures"
```

**Combine both (courses matching both criteria):**

```shell
$ canvas-downloader -t 115 -c CS1101S
```

The tool will show you all files to be downloaded with their sizes, then ask for confirmation before proceeding. Downloads are organized by course, preserving Canvas's folder structure.

> **Note:** Course name matching is exact match - use the exact course code (e.g., "CS1101S") or the exact course name as shown in the discovery step.

## What Gets Downloaded

- [x] Files
- [x] Modules
- [x] Syllabi (in HTML and JSON)
- [x] Assignments (in HTML and JSON)
- [x] Discussions and announcements (in HTML and JSON)
- [x] Pages (in HTML and JSON)
- [x] User information (in JSON)
- [ ] Panopto lecture videos (seems still buggy)

## Common Workflows

### Filter What You Download

Create a `.canvasignore` file in your current directory to skip certain files using `.gitignore` syntax:

```shell
# Ignore all videos
*.mp4
*.mov

# Ignore specific courses
/CS1101S/

# Ignore lecture recordings folder
lecture-recordings/
```

The tool automatically loads `.canvasignore` from the current directory if it exists. You can also specify a custom ignore file with `-i`:

```shell
$ canvas-downloader -t 115 -i custom-ignore.txt
```

See the [example file](examples/.canvasignore) for more patterns.

### Keep Your Files Updated

Use `-n` to overwrite local files with newer versions from Canvas:

```shell
$ canvas-downloader -t 115 -n
```

By default, existing local files won't be overwritten even if Canvas has newer versions.

### Choose Download Location

Specify a custom folder with `-d`:

```shell
$ canvas-downloader -t 115 -d ~/Canvas
```

### See Debug Information

Use `-v` to enable verbose output for troubleshooting:

```shell
# Enable debug logging
$ canvas-downloader -t 115 -v
```

Without `-v`, only important progress messages are shown (info level).
